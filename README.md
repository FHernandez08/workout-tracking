# Workout Tracking Project w/ API Post

The purpose of this project was to implement what was learned about POST requests in python using the requests module.
It featured using information collected from one response and used to produce data on the Google sheet that was included to be used for the project.
To access the Google sheet, I used the Sheety API to post information from the Nutritionix API (where the information was collected) to be posted and added onto the Google sheet
as a new row.

Overall, I enjoyed this project, I did have some struggle with it just trying to access the information from the data collected from the response created by POST request to the Nutritionix API.

I am going to continue working on projects like these, to further better my knowledge in API's as I also work on them in JavaScript.
